# hostsTools

A utility, written in Go, to evaluate and format hosts files.

I am the chief curator of [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts), which consolidates several reputable hosts files, and merges them into a unified hosts file with duplicates removed. A variety of tailored hosts files are also provided provided.

This repo provides tooling to help manage this.
